▶️ How to Run the Project Locally
📌 Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher)

MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)

npm or yarn

🔧 Backend Setup
cd backend
npm install


Create a .env file inside the backend folder:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key


Start the backend server:

npm run dev


The backend will run on:

http://localhost:5000

🎨 Frontend Setup
cd frontend
npm install

Start the frontend development server:

npm run dev

The frontend will run on:

http://localhost:5173

🔗 Connect Frontend & Backend

Ensure backend is running before starting frontend

Axios is used for API communication

JWT token is sent via Authorization headers for protected routes

🔄 Application Flow

User registers and logs in

JWT token is generated and stored

User selects technology & difficulty

Quiz is attempted sequentially

Result is calculated and stored

User views filtered results in My Results page

📈 Performance Rules
Difficulty	Questions	Score Threshold	Label
Basic	20	≥ 85%	Excellent
Intermediate	40	≥ 65%	Good
Advanced	60	≥ 45%	Average
Any	—	< 45%	Needs Work
🔒 Security Highlights

Passwords are never stored in plain text

JWT verification middleware protects sensitive routes

Users can access only their own quiz results

Input validation & proper error handling implemented

🧪 Testing

Backend APIs tested using Thunder Client

Authentication and protected routes verified

Frontend–backend integration tested with Axios
